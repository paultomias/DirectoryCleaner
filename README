/**
delete.py - cleans up log files (except install.log) in LAWDIR/system older than 2 days. For test machines, this also deletes installers in LAWDIR/system/backup but retains the latest 10 installers.
**/

/**Step-by-step setup**/
1. Download and install Python in your machine. Python 3 is preferred but this will also run in Python 2 (I think ;) ).
2. Checkout the codes from this CVS repository: LSFe/DirectoryCleaner
3. Run init.bat/enter.cmd depending on whether you're using a binary box or a sandbox
4. Run stoplaw to be able to delete logs in LAWDIR/system
5. CD to the location of the Python scripts
6. Run python delete.py
